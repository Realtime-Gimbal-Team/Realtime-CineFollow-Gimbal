# Realtime-CineFollow-Gimbal
CineFollow-Gimbal is a real-time, shooting-oriented pan–tilt gimbal designed as an intelligent camera accessory. It uses vision-based feedback to smoothly keep a subject centred in frame. The current prototype supports smartphone payloads, with future compatibility planned for mirrorless and cinema cameras via standard 1/4-inch mounts.
